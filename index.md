Introduction

For my project, I will be exploring the total land precipitation trends within the Northeast United States through the years of 1990-2010. One of the most concerning aspects of climate change is how it will impact global weather patterns, and this is my main motivation in choosing precipitation as my research variable. My intention is to discover any conclusive changes in the Northeast U.S. on a recent scale, as this is a region with unusual patterns of precipitation compared to the rest of the U.S. This is mainly due to the Lake-Effect snowfall from the Great Lakes, as well as the strong and varied precipitation caused by the cold core cyclones that occur in the winter, known as "Nor'Easters." I also intend to indentify any changes in the precipitation trends for spring and summer, as it is important to include all forms of precipitation in my research since my dataset accounts for all of them.
