Introduction

For my project, I will be exploring the total land precipitation trends within the Northeast United States through the years of 1990-2010. One of the most concerning aspects of climate change is how it will impact global weather patterns, and this is my main motivation in choosing precipitation as my research variable. My intention is to discover any conclusive changes in the Northeast U.S. on a recent scale, as this is a region with unusual patterns of precipitation compared to the rest of the U.S. This is mainly due to the Lake-Effect snowfall from the Great Lakes, as well as the strong and varied precipitation caused by the cold core cyclones that occur in the winter, known as "Nor'Easters." I also intend to indentify any changes in the precipitation trends for spring and summer, as it is important to include all forms of precipitation in my research since my dataset accounts for all of them.

Data

My project will make use of the ERA5 Global Reanalysis, which is a data set that covers a massive amount of atmospheric and weather data, including precipitation and temperature data, which spans as far back as the mid-1900s (Hersbach et al, 2020). The ERA5 Global Reanalysis was created by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and is consistently updated with both new and changing atmospheric data (ECMWF, n.d.). Because of the size of this data set, I will only be working with northeast region of the U.S., while focusing on the variable of total precipitation between the years of 1990-2010.
