For my final project, I will be performing an analysis on the Northeast United States for the years of 1991-2010. To be specific, the Northeast U.S. will be plotted on the longitudinal ranges of 80W to 60W and latitudinal ranges of 38N to 48N, and this will include the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. The data variable I will be analyzing is total precipitation, and I will only be focusing on precipitation over land, so any ocean precipitation will be cut out from any plots or trends that I include in my final project.

My project will make use of the ERA5 Global Reanalysis, which is a data set that covers a massive amount of atmospheric and weather data, including precipitation and temperature data, which spans as far back as the mid-1900s (Hersbach et al, 2020). The ERA5 Global Reanalysis was created by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and is consistently updated with both new and changing atmospheric data (ECMWF, n.d.). Because of the size of this data set, I will likely narrow my analysis down to only northeast region of the U.S. (exact latitudes and longitudes not yet determined), while focusing on the variable of precipitation trends between the years of 1990-2010.

The main purpose of my project is to discover any changes in precipitation trends over the specified time span. To accomplish this, I plan to create plots that show trends in precipitation for each month of the year through 1991-2010, as this will allow me to identify which months show the strongest changes in precipitation trends (if any). In addition, I will include maps for the years that show the strongest negative and positive anomalies of total precipitation, and possibly ones that show total precipitation trends over shorter time spans (1991-1995, 1996-2000, etc.).
