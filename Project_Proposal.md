For my final project, I will be performing an analysis on the Northeast United States for the years of 1990-2010. To be specific, the Northeast U.S. will be plotted on the longitudinal ranges of 80W to 60W and latitudinal ranges of 38N to 48N, and this will include the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. The data variable I will be analyzing is total precipitation, and I will only be focusing on precipitation over land, so any ocean precipitation will be cut out from any plots or trends that I include in my final project.

My project will make use of the ERA5 Global Reanalysis, which is a data set that covers a massive amount of atmospheric and weather data, including precipitation and temperature data, which spans as far back as the mid-1900s (Hersbach et al, 2020). The ERA5 Global Reanalysis was created by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and is consistently updated with both new and changing atmospheric data (ECMWF, n.d.). Because of the size of this data set, I will only be working with northeast region of the U.S., while focusing on the variable of total precipitation between the years of 1990-2010.

The main purpose of my project is to discover any changes in precipitation trends over the specified time span. To accomplish this, I plan to create plots that show trends in precipitation for each month of the year through 1991-2010, as this will allow me to identify which months show the strongest changes in precipitation trends (if any). In addition, I will include maps for the years that show the strongest negative and positive anomalies of total precipitation, and possibly ones that show total precipitation trends over shorter time spans (1990-1995, 1996-2000, etc.).

In the figure above, the average daily precipitation for the entire 1990-2010 time span is plotted with the AlbersEqualArea cartopy projection. I plan to create more projections similar to this one over smaller time spans, as well as individual years that show strong positive or negative anomalies of daily precipitation. Also, the figure displays precipitation data within Canada, which is outside of my region of analysis. I will remove this data by masking it out with the Regionmask Python package, which will help aleviate any confusion that may be caused by my figures displaying data in Canada.

In the next figure, my data is plotted across a 12 month span, with each individual plot representing the average daily precipitation for each month between 1990-2010. For my project, I do not intend to create a similar plot for each individual year, but I will likely create plots over multiple years within the 1990-2010 time span, and for the years that show the strongest anomalies. Also, I will mask out the data that is plotted within Canada by using the same process as the previous figure. 

For the remainder of my project, I intend to perform multiple mathematical functions that will make my results more clear. Aside from calculating mean and standard deviation values over my specified time span, my intention is to calculate linear regression functions over the full time span and several smaller periods. Also, I intend to create maps that plot the precipitation anomalies from the mean values for years that show the strongest negative and positive anomalies. Finally, I would like to find the areas within my analysis region that show the most and least total precipitation, and then attempt to plot the precipitation trends over the entire 1990-2010 time span and find any changes that may have occurred throughout this period.
